## Project Idea
This project will try to establish and illustrate a link between housing value in a zip code and the school rating. We will examine crime rate, demographics and property tax as influences on housing values. School rating is determined by grades and FSA scores.

### Null Hypothesis
There is no correlation between housing values and school ratings.

### Alternative Hypothesis
Housing values affect school ratings. Schools in zip codes with higher housing values have higher ratings.

### Data Sources
FLDOE.org - Florida schools database
https://gis2017-01-10t133755357z-hillsborough.opendata.arcgis.com/ - Data for schools in Hillsborough County
https://data.census.gov/cedsci/profile?g=0500000US12057 - Census data for Hillsborough County
https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/api - Crime information from FBI database

### How We Will Investigate
We will establish the method for rating schools through the Department of Education databases, then determine the rating of the schools for the Hillsborough County schools we are investigating. We will draw data from the US Census data to establish housing values within the zip codes and compare them to the school ratings in the same zip code. We can draw crime data from the FBI database to determine if there is a correlation between crime rate and property value.
